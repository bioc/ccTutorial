* chr1.out
the file chr1.out is an example for a single-chromosome Exonerate output
file. the other chromosome files have been omitted from this archive for
saving space. The single file "allChromExonerateOut.txt" holds the data
for all chromosomes. It has been created calling the Perl script
'condenseExonerateOutput.pl' before removing the other chromosome output
files.
